"outDir": "./build", 
"sourceMap": true, - help in debugging 
"rootDir": "./",   -where the compilation should start

import something by default it's a funtcion getting called and return or give us an object.

dotenv file to setup the port and give us config function and create an object through it

one file (.js) should only be concerned about 1 responsiblity
so create seperate file for importing config and for port listen

//tsconfig - compile typecript to js and create a build which has index.js and run it with node

for one request  there can only be one response

global middleware is executed whatever the request is 

global middleware should be defined first or at the start to avoid errors
